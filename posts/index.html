<p>The purpose of this project is to take different images of food items and attempt to classify them into categories. There are 50 different types of food used, with 1,000 of images per type, resulting in 50,000 images to sort through. I used the Convolutional Neural Network model to break a part the images and learn them piece by piece. During the preprocessing stage, each image needed to be resized and scaled. The labels for each image needed to be reformatted to create one hot representation. After experimenting with the layers, nodes, and attributes, the model was found to have a max approximate 25% accuracy reading for the images used.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to use the data taken after 10 minutes of solo ranked gameplay and predict a win. There are 40 attributes recorded for each game: gameID, a blue team win/loss, and the other 38 are split between each team for different goals achieved. These goals include kills, deaths, towers destroyed, etc. This dataset has approximately 10,000 games saved. After doing proper preprocessing and experimenting with this data, three models were used for prediction: Logistic Regression, K-neighbors, and Support Vector Classification (SVC). All models did exceptionally well but two proved about 5% more accurate. After running the models several times, the following are average scores generated: Log-Reg = 0.73, KN = 0.68, SVC = 0.73.</p>
